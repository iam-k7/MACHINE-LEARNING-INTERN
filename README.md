# MACHINE LEARNING INTERN – TASKS

This repository contains all the Machine Learning tasks completed as part of my ML internship.  
Each task includes data exploration, model building, prediction, and evaluation using standard ML techniques.

## 📁 Tasks Overview

### ✅ Task 1 — Restaurant Rating Prediction

**Goal:** Build a regression model to predict restaurant aggregate ratings based on features like price, votes, and service options.

**Approach:**
- Data preprocessing (handle missing values, encode categorical features)
- Model training using regression algorithms
- Evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) & R-squared

**Outcome:** Model that can estimate expected restaurant ratings from features.

---

### ✅ Task 2 — Restaurant Recommendation

**Goal:** Design a recommendation system that suggests restaurants based on user preferences.

**Approach:**
- Feature extraction of restaurant attributes
- Similarity measurements (e.g., cosine similarity)
- Return most relevant restaurants based on user input

**Outcome:** A logic-based recommendation engine tailored to user needs.

### ✅ Task 3 — Cuisine Classification

**Goal:** Classify restaurants by their cuisine type using supervised ML.

**Approach:**
- Feature selection and preprocessing (label encoding, one-hot encoding)
- Train classification models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall

**Outcome:** A trained classifier that predicts cuisine categories for new restaurant data.
